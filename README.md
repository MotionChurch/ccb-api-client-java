# ccb-api-client-java

ccb-api-client-java is a Java library for accessing the
[Church Community Builder][CCB] [API][APIDOCS].

This library is not provided nor supported by Church Community Builder.
It was build by Jesse Morgan for use in the [Foursquare GROW][GROW] project
and released with the hopes of helping anyone else using the CCB API.

Only a few services are currently supported. The client currently supports:

* `individual_profiles`
* `individual_profile_from_id`
* `individual_profile_from_login_password`
* `individual_profile_from_micr`
* `custom_field_labels`

Adding new services is relatively easy. Skip down to the Contributing section
if the one you need is missing.

## Usage

1. Create a single instance of CCBAPIClient for your application.
CCBAPIClient is thread-safe and manages its own pool of HTTP connections.

   ```java
   CCBAPI ccbClient = new CCBAPIClient("mychurch", "myuser", "mypassword");
   ```

2. Call the necessary APIs. For example, to get an individual by id:

   ```java
   try {
       GetIndividualProfilesRequest request = new GetIndividualProfilesRequest()
               .withIndividualId(48);
       GetIndividualProfilesResponse response = mAPI.getIndividualProfiles(request);
   } catch (CCBRetryableErrorException e) {
       // TODO: Retry if necessary with an appropriate back-off.
   } catch (CCBErrorResponseException e) {
       // TODO: Optionally handle error responses from CCB differently than below.
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // TODO: Handle other errors.
   }
   ```

3. Do something useful with the responses from CCB.

   ```java
   IndividualProfile profile = response.getIndividuals().get(0);
   System.out.println(profile.getFullName());
   ```

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request

### Adding New Services

1. Create the request class. The request class should use a builder pattern to
   collect all of the required and optional parameters. For an example, see
   [GetIndividualProfilesRequest.java](src/main/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/model/GetIndividualProfilesRequest.java).

2. Create classes for the response and other models. This is really the hardest
   part. For an example see [GetCustomFieldLabelsResponse.java](src/main/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/model/GetCustomFieldLabelsResponse.java)
   and [CustomField.java](src/main/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/model/CustomField.java).

3. Add tests for binding the models:

    1. Create an XML file from the sample response in the API documentation.
       For an example, see [ccb_custom_field_labels_response.xml](src/test/resources/com/p4square/ccbapi/model/ccb_custom_field_labels_response.xml).

    2. Add a test to verify all the fields bind correctly.
       See [GetCustomFieldLabelsResponseTest.java](src/test/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/model/GetCustomFieldLabelsResponseTest.java).

4. Add methods for the new service to [CCBAPI.java](src/main/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/CCBAPI.java)
   and [CCBAPIClient.java](src/main/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/CCBAPIClient.java).

4. Add tests for your new service to [CCBAPIClientTest.java](src/test/java/com/p4square/ccbapi/CCBAPIClientTest.java).
